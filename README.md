# Voy Microservices Project
Overview
This project implements a cloud-native system using a microservices architecture to manage trips and user preferences. The system consists of three primary microservices:

Config Server (port: 8888) â€“ Manages environment-specific configurations (dev/prod).
Trip Service (port: 8081) â€“ Handles trip itineraries (CRUD operations for trips).
User Service (port: 8082) â€“ Manages user preferences and settings.
Tech Stack
âœ… Backend: Spring Boot (Microservices)
âœ… Database: PostgreSQL (Local & Cloud Deployment)
âœ… Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
âœ… Configuration Management: Spring Cloud Config Server
âœ… API Testing: Postman

### Canonical Data Model & Microservices
Trip Service: CRUD operations for trip itineraries.
User Service: CRUD operations for user data.
Configuration Server: Centralized configuration management.
Database: Uses a relational database (PostgreSQL) for storing structured data.
Running the Project
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Then, run:


`docker-compose up --build`
This command will:

Build and start all microservices in Docker containers.
Set up the database and config server.
